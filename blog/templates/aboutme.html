    Well thanks for showing an interest in me!
    <br /> <br /> 
    My name is actually Stuart Larsen, but people generally either call me Princess or they meow at me, so I don't hear my name too often.
    <br /> <br /> 
    I've been 1337h4x0ring since I was a wee child. I started out programming my Ti-83 to cheat on math/science exams back in middle school and have been cheating (and sometimes programming) ever since!
    <br /> <br />
    I started learning FORTRAN (that was a mistake) and moved to C/C++, and I mostly messed around with terminal games (RPGs, pong, asteroids, stuff like that). 
    <br /> <br /> 
    In high school I got a job working at the <a href="http://solar-heliospheric.engin.umich.edu/"> Solar and Helioshperic Research Group </a> (SHRG). I had a great time there building Qt/C++ applications, setting up web servers, deciphering 80_86x flight code, and writing data and algorithmic anaylisis <a href="http://solar-heliospheric.engin.umich.edu/messenger/hkreports.php"> libraries </a>. 
    <br /> <br /> 
    I was enrolled into an all guys school, Michigan Technological University, with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Why Electrical Engineering instead of Computer Science? I thought it'd be good to branch out and learn something else beside programming. But, I end up spending all my time programming anyways. But hey, I tried it at least.
    <br /> <br />
    I'm pretty involved in Michigan Technological events. I was president of the Chess Club my freshman year, I learned and then taught swing dance lessons, and I'm in AFROTC. I also teach chess lessons and program in programing competitions.
    <br /> <br /> 
    Unfortunately I got tired of the job at Solar and Helioshperic Research Group and started branching out. I did a bunch of independent programming for awhile. Android Dev, embedded stuff (MSP430, Arduino, PICs) and learned some new languages (python, Haskell, lisp..). I also attended a conference in Waterloo, Ontario on Quantum Key Distribution which I really enjoyed.
    <br /> <br />
    For Fall of 2012 I was accepted into a Cyber Engineering Program at Syracuse University where I learned principals of security and assurance. I also interned at Serco doing mission assurance work in cloud computing environments. Learning how to 1337h4x0rz and such.
    <br /> <br/>
    Since returning to Michigan Technological I've been writing tutorials for Raspberry Pi's, doing some personal projects on data mining / collective intelligence, and writing this blog!
    <br /> <br />
    I recently accepted a job at <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/"> Fog Creek Software</a> for the summer of 2013. I don't know what I'll be doing, but I suspect some sort of web/mobile application development.
    <br /> <br />
    Thanks for reading!
